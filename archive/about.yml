    We're working with Carol's videos because her irreverent mix of social activism and humour is as relevant now as it was 30 years ago. Her bold satire and provocative character performance remains an inspiration for a new generation of shit-disturbers, political clowns, and unrepentant whores.

    In terms of what we're actually doing with the videos: I think they will be chopped up and remixed into a series of installation/environmental videos pieces. These will be shown alongside performances that take inspiration from Carol's spirit of joyful mischief and political rebellion.
