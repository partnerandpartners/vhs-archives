  "We were moved by Jahanara's heartfelt ability to speak clearly and honestly about her beliefs on homosexuality."
  "We were impressed with Juanita’s camera and editing work and the way in which she captured Jahanara’s powerful presence, humor and vulnerability."
  "We were inspired by Jahanara’s ability, as an eight year old, to have a decisive point of view, and handle conflict gracefully regarding homosexuality."
  — Deborah, Carolyn, & Bhurin
